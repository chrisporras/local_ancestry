## Notes
UKBioBank data located in regen2 node in path: `/sc/arion/projects/ipm2/christian/`

`phased_genotypes/` contains .bgen files

`scripts/` contains old sample scripts for prepping genotype data for RFMix. Look through this and model workflow off of it (will need to update paths).

`metadata/` contains reference panel labels

`genetic_maps/` is empty but will contain RFMix input map for painting.
